    "# Adding new data to Open-Canopy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we describe how to add new data to the Open-Canopy dataset. The process is straightforward once you understand the structure of the dataset. Quoting section A-3 of the supplementary material of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09392):\n",
    "\"\n",
    "The composition of the `canopy_height` folder is the following:\n",
    "- The file `geometries.geojson` stores a list of [...] geolocated geometries, giving access to the splits of the dataset. It can be loaded using the python package geopandas. Each geometry designates either a train, validation, test or buffer area. This information is stored in the column `split` [...]. Additionally, each geometry is associated to a year (corresponding to the year of the corresponding LiDAR acquisition), stored in the column `lidar_year`.\n",
    "*NB: In the original \"Open-Canopy\" dataset, the column \"lidar_year\" refers to the acquisition year of lidar data,\n",
    "but in a more general context, it designates a spatio-temporal zone with a unique crs, and should be filled with the name of the folder where to retrieve data for each geometry.*\n",
    "- The file `forest_mask.parquet` stores geolocated geometries of forests’ outlines. It can be loaded using the python package geopandas.[...]\n",
    "- Each folder 2021, 2022 and 2023 contains three files:\n",
    "    - `lidar.vrt` is a geolocalized virtual file that gives access to SPOT 6-7 images stored in the subfolder spot. It can be accessed through Qgis software 2 or python rasterio library 3 for instance. It has the same extent as the geometries of the associated year.\n",
    "    - Similarly `lidar.vrt` gives access to ALS-derived (LiDAR) canopy height maps stored in the subfolder lidar.\n",
    "    - Similarly `lidar_classification.vrt` gives access to classification rasters stored in the subfolder lidar_classification.\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hence, perform the following steps to add new data**\n",
    "- Create a new folder in the folder `canopy_height`.\n",
    "- In the newly created folder, add the following files:\n",
    "    - a GeoTIFF (`tif` extension) file (or a`vrt` with its associated files) named `spot.tif` for satellite imagery, at resolution 1.5m, with four bands RGB and NIR. See [preprocessing](../src/preprocessing/README.md) for pansharpening of SPOT imagery at 1.5m resolution. If you plan to use satellite or aerial imagery that comes from a different sensor, we recommend first applying histogram matching or a related technique with SPOT preprocessed data.\n",
    "    - [For evaluation/training] a `tif` (or `vrt`) named `lidar.tif` for ground truth canopy height, stored in decimeters, at 1.5m resolution\n",
    "    - [Optional for evaluation/training] a mask, stored in a `tif` (or `vrt`) named `lidar_classification.tif` specifying where to perform evaluation/training (cf. [evaluation config](../src/metrics/configs/compute_metrics_config.yaml)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then update the `geometries.geojson` file to reflect the new training or evaluation set, as shown below.\n"
